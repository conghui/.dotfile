Personal vim configuration

Installation
============
As all plugins are handled by
[NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim), you have to install
*NeoBundle* at the first place with the following command:

    git submodule init && git submodule update

Other plugins will be installed when you launch vim.

Update Submodules
=============
Run `:NeoBundleUpdate` to update plugins in vim.
